    <h1>Windows Server Home Lab with Active Directory and Domain Controller</h1>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Home Lab goes over the process of how I created a Windows Server virtual machine in VirtualBox, then installed Active Directory and promoted the server to Domain Controller.</p>
    
    <h2>Project Walk-Through</h2>
    <h3>Part 1: VirtualBox Windows Server Active Directory Domain Controller and static IP</h3>
    <p>To complete this lab, I installed VirtualBox to run my virtual machines. I started with the Windows Server virtual machine. I spun up a new virtual machine in VirtualBox named <strong>EJC-DC-01</strong> and selected <strong>Windows 2019</strong> as the operating system. I downloaded the ISO file for Windows Server 2019 and allocated 4 GB of memory and 2 processors.</p>
    <p>After booting up the VM, I installed Windows without a product key and ran the following command in PowerShell to generate a product key that was valid until the year 2038. I now had a Windows Server Virtual Machine with a valid product key. Following this, through Server Manager, I navigated to <strong>Manage > Add Roles and Features</strong> and installed <strong>Active Directory Domain Services</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Then, I navigated to <strong>Flag > Promote this server to Domain Controller</strong>. I named the domain <em>ejc.local</em> and completed the AD DS Configuration Wizard.</p>
    
    <p>Next, I set the virtual machine to a static IP address. To do this, I clicked on Ethernet settings under the Local Server tab in Server Manager. This took me to Network Connections in Control Panel. I navigated to <strong>Ethernet > Properties > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties</strong>. Here, I changed the IP address to <strong>10.0.2.64</strong> and the subnet mask to <strong>255.255.255.0</strong>. Earlier, I went into the Command Prompt and used the <em>ipconfig</em> command to find the default gateway, which was <strong>10.0.2.2</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>In that same menu, I changed the gateway accordingly. The final network settings are shown below.</p>
