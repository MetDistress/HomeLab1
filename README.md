Windows Server Home Lab
<h1>Windows Server Home Lab with Active Directory and Domain Controller</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this home lab is to advance my knowledge of Windows Server, Active Directory, and Systems Administration.</p>
<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>To complete this lab, I have installed VirtualBox to run my virtual machines. I started with the Windows Server virtual machine. I spun up a new virtual machine in VirtualBox named EJC-DC-01 and selected Windows 2019 as the operating system. I downloaded the ISO file for Windows Server 2019 and allocated 4 GB of memory and 2 processors. Following this, I booted up the VM, and installed Windows without a product key. After this, I ran the following command in PowerShell. </p>
